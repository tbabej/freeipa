This module contains default empty implementation of the Authconfig class.

# TODO: Remove AuthConfig class from the ipaplatform.base and use defined tasks
# in ipaplatform.tasks that call Authconfig internally.


class AuthConfig(object):
    """
    AuthConfig class implements system-independent interface to configure
    system authentication resources. In Red Hat systems this is done with
    authconfig(8) utility.

    AuthConfig class is nothing more than a tool to gather configuration
    options and execute their processing. These options then converted by
    an actual implementation to series of a system calls to appropriate
    utilities performing real configuration.

    IPA *expects* names of AuthConfig's options to follow authconfig(8)
    naming scheme!

    Actual implementation should be done in ipapython/platform/<platform>.py
    by inheriting from platform.AuthConfig and redefining __build_args()
    and execute() methods.

    from ipapython.platform import platform
    class PlatformAuthConfig(platform.AuthConfig):
        def __build_args():
        ...

        def execute():
        ...

    authconfig = PlatformAuthConfig
    ....

    See ipapython/platform/redhat.py for a sample implementation that uses
    authconfig(8) as its backend.

    From IPA code perspective, the authentication configuration should be
    done with use of ipapython.services.authconfig:

    from ipapython import services as ipaservices
    auth_config = ipaservices.authconfig()
    auth_config.disable("ldap").\
                disable("krb5").\
                disable("sssd").\
                disable("sssdauth").\
                disable("mkhomedir").\
                add_option("update").\
                enable("nis").\
                add_parameter("nisdomain","foobar")
    auth_config.execute()

    If you need to re-use existing AuthConfig instance for multiple runs,
    make sure to call 'AuthConfig.reset()' between the runs.
